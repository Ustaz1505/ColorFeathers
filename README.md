# ColorFeathers
Usage: ```/sign``` while holding feather in offhand and item in main hand.

With a piece of luck you can get special feather and an advancement. This feather will have random color and then you can sign items with it or write in chat with that color when holding it in offhand.

All parameters are configurable in `/plugins/colorFeathers/config.yml`

If you want to change language you can use these language files in your `config.yml`:

| Language | Code  |        File        |
|:--------:|:-----:|:------------------:|
| Russian  |  ru   |  messages_ru.yml   |
| English  | en-us | messages_en-us.yml |

You can also add your own language to `/plugins/EasyPM/languages/` and use it as well.

If you want to translate plugin and make your translation pre-installed on the plugin [open a new pull request](https://github.com/Ustaz1505/EasyPM/pulls "Github pull requests").

To reload all configs use ```/cfs reload```
